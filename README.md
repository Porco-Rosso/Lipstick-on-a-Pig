# Lipstick on a Pig üíÑüêΩ

![motd screenshot](screenshot.png)

Simple MOTD using golang and [Lipgloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss) by [Charm¬©](https://charm.sh/)

I use it to get basic information when I log in to my many containers and VMs. Should work on any modern version of Mac, Debian and probably other linux distros. First time programming in go, but at least it Looks pretty!

Shows:
- OS
- Local IP
- Total Disk space and free space
- Uptime
- RAM size and usage
- CPU size and usage

Color is selected based on a hash of the hostname!

Pull requests welcome!
